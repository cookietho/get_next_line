# get_next_line
## Description of the Project
###### The purpose of this project is to write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. The function must eventually return the whole data from a file descriptor line by line. 

## What I learned from this
###### I was able to manipulate how to make a function that reads a file descriptor a line by line. This projected helped me to understand better in allocation.
